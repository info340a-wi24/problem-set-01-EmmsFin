        <cite><a href="https://riordan.fandom.com/wiki/Percy_Jackson">Percy Jackson</a></cite> is a demigod child of Sally Jackson and Posidon. 
        
        He is the main character and sole narrator of <cite><a href="https://rickriordan.com/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/">Percy Jackson and the Olympian series</a></cite> by Rick Riordon. 
        
        He is also the a main character and occasional narrator of the <cite><a href="https://rickriordan.com/series/the-heroes-of-olympus/">Heroes of Olympus series</a></cite>. 
        
        In <cite><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0814255/">2010</a></cite> and <cite><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1854564/">2013</a></cite> movies based of the first two books in the series were released with Logan Lerman playing Percy Jackson. 
        
        The movies were enteraining but entirely inaccurate, thus, similarly to the <cite><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417299/">Avatar the Last Airbender movie</a></cite>, they "do not exist." 
        
        In late 2023/early 2024, a Disney+ series called <cite><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12324366/">Percy Jackson and the Olympians</a></cite> was released, with 5 epidodes already released and 3 episodes left.

        There are many aspects I admire about Percy Jackson, here are just a few:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Percy Jackson has dyslexia and ADHD. As a child struggling with dyslexia, reading the Percy Jackson series with a main character that faced the same learning difficulties as it was extremely influential in my learning to love reading!</li>
        <li>Percy Jackson has strong morals and typically thinks about the greater good over his own needs. For example *spoiler alert* he is willing to sacrifice immortality to help other demigods receive recognition and parental-support from their godly parents.</li>
        <li class="important">Percy Jackson is able to eat, and is obsessed with, blue dye. As someone that is allergic to blue dye, this is an amazing feat.</li>
    </ul>
